# Vite svelte widgets

This includes sample widgets `widget-a` and `widget-b`. The documentations and examples (for development) live in the files `widget-a.html` and `widget-b.html`.
Both files contain code to load the respective widget and render it.

- Run `pnpm i`
- Run `pnpm dev` to see the widgets live-reloading (it opens a browser at the `widget-a`)
- Build with `pnpm build`
- Preview the build documentation with `pnpm preview` (also opens)
- Run `pnpm dev` and visit `/test-widget-a.html` to see a host page that embeds `widget-a` (only works after building)
